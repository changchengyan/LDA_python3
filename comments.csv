0,I stayed here during SXSW and had a really pleasant stay.  The house is a very relaxing environment and Paddy is both a friendly and professional host. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"Great place, close enough to everything downtown Austin has, yet just far enough to be relaxing and quiet.  An excellent place to regroup and recharge.  Paddy respected my privacy and different hours.  The place is clean and hip - I would stay with Paddy again.  You must be okay with dogs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"We had a great time in Austin staying at Paddy's house. The house is much larger than it looks on the photos, very clean and the moment you step in you feel like home. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm back in Austin. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"We had a great stay at Zen East for South By Southwest!  Paddy was extremely accommodating and we found the place to be exotic and homely.  It was easy to settle right in and experience Austin, and everything was a short taxi or bus ride away.  She had everything we needed for our stay, and we loved the zen vibe of the backyard garden.

4,"I arrived late in the evening so did not meet Paddy, but her home was lovely and clean and welcoming. She checked in with my friend and I most days to make sure that we had no questions or needed anything. All in all, a very smooth, stress-free experience in Austin!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
